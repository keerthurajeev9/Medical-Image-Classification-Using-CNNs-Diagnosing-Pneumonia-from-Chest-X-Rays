# Medical Image Classification Using CNNs: Diagnosing Pneumonia from Chest X-Rays
## Description
This project focuses on classifying chest X-ray images into two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. Using deep learning and the Torch library in R, our goal is to automate pneumonia detection to assist healthcare professionals and enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

## Project Goals
Automate the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images.
Improve diagnostic speed and reduce human error.
Make diagnostic services more accessible in areas with limited healthcare resources.
Dataset
Source: Pediatric chest X-rays from Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center.
Classes: Normal and Pneumonia (bacterial and viral).
Quality Assurance: Images were quality-checked and labeled by expert physicians.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, install R and the following packages:
install.packages(c("torch", "torchvision", "luz", "gridExtra", "jpeg", "imager", "magick", "dplyr", "EBImage"))

## For Bioconductor dependencies:

## Usage
### Data Preprocessing
Normalizes pixel values and resizes images to a uniform size of 224x224.
### Data Augmentation
Applies transformations like random horizontal and vertical flips and color jittering to increase data diversity.
### Model Training
Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with Torch in R.
### Evaluation
Performance metrics include accuracy, loss plots, and additional classification metrics.
Model Architectures
Custom CNN: Features convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
MobileNet: Lightweight, efficient architecture ideal for mobile applications.
ResNet: Deep residual network used for performance comparison.
### Results
Evaluation metrics and comparisons between different architectures.
